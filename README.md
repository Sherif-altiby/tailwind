### Description

- usinge vite in createing react app. Vite is optimized for modern browsers that support ES module imports. Instead of bundling all your code into a single file, Vite serves individual files for each module, leveraging browser support for native module loading.

 How to use vite:

```
vite create my-react-app --template react
```

- using Typescript: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development. This can lead to fewer runtime errors and more robust code.

  using typescript with react:

 ```
  npm install --save typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
 ```

- using Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS allows for rapid prototyping by providing utility classes that cover a wide range of styling needs. You can quickly build and iterate on UI designs without having to write custom CSS.

using Tailwind CSS with react:

```
npm install tailwindcss
```
